                    `JMC Limousine was performing well in its operations but lacked an online presence. The company did not have a website, business email, or domain, which limited its visibility and accessibility to potential clients. The absence of an online platform meant that the owner had to spend a significant amount of time on the phone, answering the same questions repeatedly. This not only consumed valuable time but also represented a financial loss in the long run, as the time spent answering repetitive questions could have been better used to attract and serve potential clients.`
